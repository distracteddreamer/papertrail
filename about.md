I have chosen the name Paper Trail to suggest the two main purposes this blog serves:

1. To maintain an account of my studies of machine learning and related fields, both near and distant
2. To track my reading of machine learning research publications.

For a while I tried to reach a modest level of finish, both in the sense of completeness and polish, before I published a post but found myself struggling to make progress. I've not lowered my standards but switched strategy.

Someday I might write beautiful memorable blog posts. For the present, the blog's purposes are served just as well by posting what notes I have, however imperfect, rough or fragmented they may be, instead of leaving them lying around, lost or forgotten.

Lastly, let me stress that this is my learning journey so if you happen refer to my notes, code, or problem solutions, don't be surprised if you find mistakes
