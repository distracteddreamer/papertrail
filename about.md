I have chosen the name Paper Trail to suggest the two main purposes this blog serves:
1. To maintain an account of my studies of machine learning and related disciplines.
2. To track my reading of machine learning research publications.

This is a learning journey so if you refer to any of my notes, implementations or solutions don't be surprised to find mistakes.
