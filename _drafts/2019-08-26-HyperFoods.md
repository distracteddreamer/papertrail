## The problem

Scale of the problem
> With rapidly ageing populations, the world is experiencing an unsustainable healthcare and economic burden from chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and **neurodegenerative disorders**. [Emphasis added]

Scope of the solution
 Diet and nutritional factors play an essential role in the prevention of these diseases and significantly influence disease outcome in patients during and after therapy.

They identify the benefits of plant-based foods for cancer prevention and treatment. What are similar properties that will be beneficial for neurodegenerative diseases.

Many factors from how the food is cultivated, processed, prepared, cooked, combined with other foods influence what the active compounds are present and result in a vast search space which cannot be explored by traditional experimental methods.

Key types of work done in this area:
- Identification of food molecules that are similar to drugs based on their structure or individual gene-encoding protein targets.
- Using *"-omics"* data to extract insights on positive and / or adverse interactions between foods, drugs and disease.
- Using chemo-informatics and NLP to define health-promoting or detrimental links between foods and disease phenotypes from PubMed abstracts.

## Methods
Complex diseases like cancer involve a breakdown of molecular functions mediated through networks or molecular interactions. They used graph networks to simulate the downstream influence of therapeutics on human proteome networks. 

Data consists of interaction between drugs and their protein / gene targets. Most drugs work by binding to a specific subset of proteins. There is also a gene-gene connection network. These are use to create propagated molecule profiles for different drugs and foods. These profiles are then classified as potential anti-cancer candidates.
