My notes from the lecture by Kevin Hale for [YC Startup School 2019](https://www.startupschool.org/). 

## Introduction 
- It is a myth that you need to have a lot of traction to get into YC - ideas can be enough.
- Lack of conviction is a reason for only working on your idea during spare time. 
- Need to learn how to talk and think about the startup. 

## How can I predict if an investor will like my idea?
- Startup = growth
- Investors have a tendency to criticise and undermine ideas
- However Paul Graham’s approach is to figure out how to win - those which ones are the non-obvious ones
- A great investor tries to imagine how the idea could take off and pitches it back to the person
- Startup idea is a hypothesis about why a company could grow quickly
- People make the mistake of over-describing it

## The three parts of a startup idea
# 1. Problem - initial conditions or setting for the company that allows it grow quickly
- A problem should be one or more of the following:
    - Popular
    - Growing 
    - Urgent
    - Expensive to solve
    - Mandatory - they have to be solved
    - **Frequent** - ones that are going to be encountered over and over again:
        - Very important as give people lots of opportunities to convert
        - Behavior change requires motivation + ability + trigger all together at once
- Ideal problems
    - Millions of people
    - Markets growing 20%/year
    - People trying to solve right now
    - Billions of dollars cost / total addressable market
    - Law change 
- Need to solve many times a day e.g. hourly usage

# 2. Solution - what is the experiment that you are basically running within the conditions for it to grow quickly?
- Don’t start with the solution - should not have solution in search of a problem (SISP).
- Such ideas as difficult but not impossible - better to use whatever is necessary to solve the problem.

# 3. Insight - what is your explanation about why your idea is going to make all this happen?
- Why should investor choose you over anyone else?
- Has to be related to growth - unfair advantage related to that
- **Necessary**
- Types of insight
    - Founders - 1 of 10 of all in the world who can solve this
    - Market - is it growing at >= 20% a year - but if only advantage then it is the weakest one to have 
    - Product - 10x better than competition - faster, cheaper, etc. - 2x, 3x, not good enough
    - Acquisition - $0 acquisition path e.g. growing by word of mouth - how do I grow this without having to pay for it?
    - Monopoly - as company grows is it more difficult for you to be defeated by competitors e.g. companies with network effects and marketplaces

## Two types of beliefs investors have about a company

1. Threshold belief - whether can you even build it - not so important because if you can't nothing else matters.
2. Miracle - if investor believes you can really do this, then it will take off - success if determined by how will you can do sales, convince people to buy.

## Examples of successful startups
# YC itself
1.  Problem - hard for founders to raise money without knowing someone in VC.
2. Solution - YC invests via open application.
3. Insight/unfair advantage:
    - Founders highly accomplished technoligists and entrepreneurs
    - Market - future multi-billion dollar companies would be tech startups - which (at least software ones) would need less money to start
    - Product - if you cover 3 months living expenses of founders and let them pitch to investors at the end, this would attract lot of founders
    - Acquistion - Paul Graham had a large target audience of hackers with his books and essays 
    - Monopoly - alumni network very valuable 

# Wufoo (Kevin Hale's company)
1. Problem - websites need to collect and information but need to be or hire programmer to do this. 
2. Solution - WYSIWYG editor to enable non-technical people to create forms/surveys
3. Insight:
    - Market - almost every website needs forms
    - Product - WSYIWYG + AJAX 10x faster and 100x cheaper/faster than hiring someone
    - Acquisition - audience of 100k developers via a blog and as forms can be embedded in website with branding at confirmation this meant it would be advertised to users of the website.
